            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>My name is 冯博群(Boqun Feng).</p>
<p>I was born at the Northeast of China, got my BS and MS degrees at SJTU in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now I’m working at IBM LTC(Linux Technology Center) now. I’m still a Linux kernel newbie, my kernel patches can be found <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Boqun">here</a>.</p>
<p>I like working on open source projects, and the projects I also got involved are <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/beignet/">beignet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv">OSv</a>. One thing I feel great about open source projects is that I’m free to make any improvement to the software and my work can be reviewed and improved by people from all over the world, and thhat’s really exciting.</p>
<p>I’m interested in system programming(OS, virtualization, etc.), programming languages(Theories and Implementations, i.e., compilers or interpreters) and mathematics. I think everyone has his or her rights to use the life, and I want to use it as a journey for truth. So the title of the blog, 朝闻道, is a good discription for my attitude towards life.</p>
